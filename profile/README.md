![](./assets/banner.jpg)

This is Prescription Prompt, a tracking app to make sure you never forget to take your medication again.\
Prescription Prompt is a mobile app built for IOS and Android using MongoDB, Express and React Native.

This Project is our final project on our Northcoders Journey. Our tasks entailed a group of 5 random students that have never worked in a group before go from an idea in a brainstorming session to a fully functioning app using frameworks and platforms we have never used before, all done in a tight time frame of 2 weeks.

Our time on this project involved creating wireframes, kanban boards, lots of pair programming and daily stand ups which helped us massively by giving us an insight into how the real world operates when working as a team. To see our final project, please follow the steps below to gain access and browse our app:
